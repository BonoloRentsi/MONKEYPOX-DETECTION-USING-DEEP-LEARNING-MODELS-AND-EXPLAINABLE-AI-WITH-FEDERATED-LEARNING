# MONKEYPOX-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-MODELS-AND-EXPLAINABLE-AI-WITH-FEDERATED-LEARNING
Monkeypox (Mpox) is a viral disease that spread rapidly and caused a significant global outbreak in 2022 and 2023, which consequently led to increased public health concern.  This increase necessitates the development of accurate and rapid diagnostic tools to support clinical decision-making and containment strategies.  This study aims to implement a robust, privacy-preserving, racially fair, and explainable Deep Learning (DL) framework integrated with Federated Learning (FL) for early and accurate Mpox detection. Four models, Densenet201, ResNet152V2, XceptionNet, and InceptionNet, were trained and evaluated using an HSV color space augmentation function to change image color properties systematically to increase image diversity.  Evaluation metrics included Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, and Mean Squared Error.  Among the models, DenseNet201 achieved the highest overall performance, with an accuracy of 99.76%, a precision of 1.0, a Sensitivity of 1.0, an F1-score of 1.0, an AUC-ROC of 1.0, and a Mean Squared Error of 0.00, slightly outperforming other architectures.  The federated client results show moderate overall performance, with Client 1 achieving 70.17% accuracy and Client 2 achieving 67.96%.  Model interpretability was addressed using Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight the lesion-focused regions, and the LIME explanations indicated that attributes such as texture, lesion boundaries, and color intensity were the most influential factors in prediction confidence. Comparative analysis with prior studies demonstrated the competitive nature of the proposed approach, while it also highlighted the current research gaps, such as dataset dependency, limited generalizability, and the need for real-world clinical validation.  The study contributes to knowledge by benchmarking multiple deep learning models on Monkeypox detection, introducing a structured evaluation of interpretability, and outlining directions for incorporating FL approaches.  Despite computational resource limitations, the findings highlight the potential of deep learning as a practical and scalable solution for infectious disease diagnosis.
