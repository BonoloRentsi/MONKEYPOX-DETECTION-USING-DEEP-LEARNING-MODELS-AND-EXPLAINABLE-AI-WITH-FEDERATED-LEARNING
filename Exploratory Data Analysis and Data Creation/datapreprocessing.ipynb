The disease has two distinct clades: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb), with clade II being the most recent mpox that has caused a global outbreak in 2024 (CDC, 2024). The focus of this project is to examine how Machine Learning models can be utilized to accurately diagnose specific disease through classification and detection techniques while considering racial bias. The ongoing global outbreak of clade II has caused more than 100 00 cases in 122 countries, including 115 countries where Mpox was not reported previously (CDC, 2024).\n\nThe fatality rate of Mpox can reach up to 11% depending on the strain and the health condition of the affected individual, with the Clade I having a mortality rate of around 3.6% (Mpox Virus: Clade I and Clade II, n.d). There is no specific treatment for Mpox, antiviral medications like tecovirimat (TPOXX) can help mitigate symptoms, but these treatments are not accessible in underprivileged areas (CDC, 2024). With the ongoing violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, efforts to control Mpox have been severely hindered by ongoing violence, which results in higher transmission rates and delayed responses.\n\nThe traditional diagnosis method is PCR testing, and Serological testing, where PCR is the primary method that uses samples from skin lesions and is the most preferred because of its high sensitivity and specificity, while Serological tests detect antibodies, but this test is less reliable due to its cross-reactivity with other orthopoxviruses (Khehra, Padda and Swift, 2023). Both these methods have their limitations, and these include the need for specialized equipment and trained personnel and the potential for false negatives due to viral mutations. Enhancing diagnostic accuracy and accessibility, especially in resource-limited environments, requires the development of a reliable computer-based framework for the detection of Mpox disease. The goal is to provide an accessible, reliable tool that aids healthcare professionals in conflict zones and underprivileged areas","metadata":{"id":"59MMEgKqNpgO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nAIM\n\nTo implement a robust, privacy-preserving, racially fair, and explainable Deep Learning framework integrated with Federated Learning for early and accurate Mpox detection.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n1.
